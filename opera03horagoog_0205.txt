chrcu uses twenty different kinds of Mensure, or varie·

ties os hietre. These are combined iu· sixteen different ways,
forming, oi course, sixteen different Strophes, or stannus* In
order to know'to which os these combinations any ode be·
longs, we have only to find the first words os that ode in the
following Alphabetioal Index3 and against them is placed the
number os the combination to which it belongs, and according
to which it may be scanned. For instanee; suppose it were
desircd to' know the kind of verse⁴ contained in the First Ode
of th‘e First Book ; look in the Alphabe'tical Index ou the next
page, and find there the first words, Moeeenos atenim and
against thern stands VII. No. VII, theu, nithe combinatione
on page 198, informs you that the verseis Asclepiadem and
shows you how it may be scanned. In the same way the
, method os scanning every ode in Horace may be known, by
finding the first words os it in the Index, and referring to the
number against it, in the combinatione.

*A strophe, or stanna, includes as many lines as are necessary to
show nli the different kinds of measure inan ode. 1t is called strophe,
which, tn Greek, literally meansa tuming,bceause, at the end oi it, you
