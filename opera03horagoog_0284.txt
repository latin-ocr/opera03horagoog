The civil war between Cesar and Pompey had been succeeded
by that between Octavius and Brutus; und when these commo-
tione had come to au end, others arose between Octavius, dieu
called Augustus, and Antony. The Roman empiro was divided
between thece chiefs, and the Adriatic was covered with their
tieeta. A battle wau ex pected, which wastodecide the fate of
the emp ire. On the eve of thia dreadful scene, Horace compoaed
unaepo p'dc m which he deplores the condition of the Roman peo-
ple‚ and intimatos that they may as well abandon their country
for ever, aa live amidst auc ch scenos of horror anduncertcinty.1n
short, th'e civil wars, which began between Marius and Sylla m
the year 666 of Rome were never perfectly extinguished u'll the
death of Antouy in 724.
