In the first part of this ode the poet describes the joy and beau-

ODE V.

much esteemed by Augustus, that he gave him his daughter Iulia
in marriage. Agrippa wished his aehievements to be celebrated
by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the more laborious
and responsible tssk of writing aformal poem, ingeniously pays

jeets3 but that Varius, gifted with the sublimest inspiratione os the
epio muse, would sing his praises in snains worthy of the subject.

Most commentatus have thought this ode merely an excuse o.
Horace for not doing that which he had no disposition to do. But

fluous. Itis probably only an instance, among many, osiris artini-
ly performing what he pretends to deabus doing
