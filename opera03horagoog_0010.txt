, 'Phe writings of Horace have au air of frankness and openneas
about them 3 a manly simplicity, and a contemptos affectation, or
the little pride of avain and mean concealment, which, at once,
take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
he gives of his own character, without scruple or suspicion. 'Phat
he was fond of pleasure is confessed3 but, generall speaking, he
was moderate and temperate in his pleasures3 an his convivial
hours seem to have been far more intellectual, and more enlight-
ened by social wit and wisdom, than are those of the common herd
of Epicurean poets.

Horace, of cll the writers of antiquity, most abounds with that
practical good sense, and familiar observation of life and manners, ’
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader’s
companion. Goodsense, inferet, seems the most distinguishing
feature of his satires3 for his wit seems rather forced; and it is
their tone of sound understauding, added ιο their easy, conversation·
al air, and a certain turn for fine raillery, that forms the secret by
which they plesse. In variety and versatility, his lyn‘c genius is
unrivalled by that of any poet with whom we are acquainted3 and
there are no marks of inequality or of inferiority ιο himself.
Whether his odes be of the moral and philosophie kind3 or the
heroic 3 the descriptive3 or the amatory, the light, and the joyous3
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar province.
His epistles evince a knowledge of the wealmesses of the human
beart, which would do honor to a professed philosopher. What
Quintilian, and the moderna aster him, call the “Art of Poetry‚”
seems to have been only the third epistle of the second book, ad-
dressedto the Pisos. 'Phe style and manner differin no respect
from the former epistles. The observatione are equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokes of satirical humor3 which
appear unsuitable to a didactic piecel*
