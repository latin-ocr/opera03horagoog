'Ibe Romans believed that many of their gods passed their sum-

of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5211 of December.
Both illese days were observed by sacrifices and festivity in hon-
or of Faunus, who was supposed topreside over their floclss and
lields. This ode was probably written for one of his festivals.
In the first part, the poet entreats Faunus, if he pays him due hon·
ors, to smile upon his fields, und preserve the tender offspring os
his flocks3 and in the second, he sets tbrtli the joy of the village
on the retum ofhis autumnal fean, when man end beust will re-
lax from their tnil, and rejoice iu the bounty of their benefactor.

ODE XIV.

It seems that Murena hed been chosen augur, end that several
os his friends had met together in honor ol the occasion 3 and thet
among them were Horace, and another poet named Telephus, who
was a great scholar, and who undertoolr to entertnin the company
with some greve discussion on ancient history. Horace interrupta
him by intimating that it were better to inquire where the best
wine was to be had, with the requisites sor an entertainment, that
they mi ht drink their fiiend’s health in honor of his new appoint-
ment he hint sucoeeded, and we are to imagine our poet in
the midst ol the entertainment, giving orders for the manner of
drinking, es though he were king of the feast.
