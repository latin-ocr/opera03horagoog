Phidyle wus e rustic women, und, us most commentatore sup-
liiil3²npi²iffdssi⁵id⁰ih⁰hissdh⁰ffin ssssffihldi
ecceptshle in proportion to their lutrinsic velue. Horace in this
ode sttempts to convince her, thet the gods regarded the disposi-
tion os mind with which sacrifices were offered, sother thun the
oostIiness of the gists3 thet purity of life ond good intentione were
ot' most Importunce3 end thet with these, nny offerings, however
small, were scceptnble.

1. Sssyrinae: when the encients prsyed to the celestiol gods,
they rsrsed their hands ‘with the pnhm upwnrds? but turned
thern dowuwsrds when they sddressed the infernal gods.

2 Nomento Laod: the occasions were very numerous on which
it wss supposed proper to mske sacrifices to the gods3 Horace
would imply thet once u mouth, ‘ut the new moon,’ wos sufficient,
end then it wes not necessary to be extravugnnt.

3. Hor-nd: i. e. prooemio anni, Adj. lomus, -o, -ιιπι,

ἀνοία, qua pasoitur nivali Algido inter ᾳιιιναω et ilicem meracis
s'rr Albane herbis, tinget συνίει secures pordfficnm. The monning
is, that these victims ere designed sor public sacrifices, which muy
with propriety be more magnificent thnn those of private individu-
els, who ought to melre their offerings proportionnte to their stn-
tion end ebilities.

15. Parvos ... mys-to: ‘crowniug your little household gods
with rosemury end tendet myrto! This is enough. You need
not attempt to appense them by the slnughter of many victims.

17. Immunes: sc. coelem,- r. e. ‘pure’

18. Non rum tuosd . . . muhd: ‘it hos uppeesed the ungry gods
with pious meuipend crnolrling solt, end would not heve been more
scoepteble with s costly sacrifice?
