ace was sent to Athens tocomplete hrs educauon Whilst Horace
was at Athens, Cesar was assassinated3 end Brutus end Cassius

favor und friendsbip of Mecenas. He filled the office of a clerk
to the treasury, and assisted tbe emperor ns bis private amanuen-
sis. This appears from the fragment of a letter from Augustus tc
his minister. “I used to be equal to the writing of my own letters3
bntl am now so pressed with n multiplicit of business, and so in-
firmthctlwishyou tobringmeour friend orace. Lethimcome,
then, and leave thot parasitical table for my palace, and assist me
in writing my letters? Another fragment of a letter from Augus·
tus to Horace, is expressed in terms of tbe most easy und playful
familiurity. “Dionysius hes conveyed your little volume to me3
which, notto quarrel with its brevity, 1 talne in good pert. But
you seem to me feerful, lest your works should be bigger than

ourself. However, what ou wantin he' ht,is made up to you
dy that little round body od yours. You ¹sgboul therefore, write
such n roll, as may go, not round asticis, butaquart measure3
and then the circumference of your volume may be squab and
swollen, like the romndity of your little belly.” This is aplessing

rsonal trait. Horace has, himselt given us some interesting

' ts of his person and manners. He was gray before bis time;
fond osbasking in the sun3 and oftsking c noro on thebanis of
e river. Hc speaks of breaking stenes and turning up tbe ground,
when in tho country, and when in town, of saunteringin the mar-
ket, or riding out on e dccli-tailed mule, which he set awkwardly.
