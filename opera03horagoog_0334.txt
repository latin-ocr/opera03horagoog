EPISTLE XIL

This e istis is addressed to the same person to whom Horace
addresse tha XXIVth Ode of the first Book. He there ralliea
Iccius with some humor on turning soldier, and abandoning his
literury and philosophical pursuits. Ha now ridiculas his love of
money, blen ed with those pursuits.

1. Ihrctihm Agri ce &odias Iccius was, at the time tbis epis-
tle was addreme sophim, ent and superintendant of the estates
ot' Agrippeia Sicily 3 an o ce of no trifling emolument.

7.1n mio poeiwmmr ‘in the midst of abundance spread
out before you.

12. Mirum ri: i. e. can we wonder that the tields aud crops
of Democritus became the prey of flocks, while his mind was
scarching for the hidden causes of things; when you, amidst so
corruptam age, where the love of gain spreads like a contagium
withdraw your mind from all low inquiries, and employ yourself
in the sublime study of nature? This is probably irony, for the
poet‘s amusement

21. Seu pisces, sea porrurnr a humorous allusion to the doctrines
ot' Pythagoras, who tau ht that the soul, in its transmigrations,
passed into plants as we as animals.

22. Utere .. . adiro deser.- ‘gives kind reception to Pompeius
Grosphus3 ondit ha request anything‚ grant it readily.'

24. Vsu . . . mot.- ‘tha harvest of friends bo be aequired is
cbeap, when good men need anything.’ Because they can be
¹gainedbliy a mutliug favor, wanting nothing hut what 'rs just and

onore e.

28. Accepit gestibus minor: ‘has received on bended kneea’

EPISTLII XIII.

It seems our poet had intrusted several rolls of bis writings,
wlnmina, to his friend Vinius Asello, to he carried to Augustus.
But he was anxious that they should he presented at a proper
time, when he might not he employed by more weighty concerns3
and that they should not, through too much zeal on the part of

his friend, hc urged upon the emperor unseusonably.
2. Signata.- he wished tlrem to be delivered sealed, that they
might not be the subject of Impertinent curiosity to the courtiers.
