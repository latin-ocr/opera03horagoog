ODE xvn:

Horace here predicts the glory and immortality of his name.
And, with the true spirit of a poet, he imagines himself already as-
suming the form and faculties of a swan, and soaring above the
earth, over which he is about ιο take his adria] flight. As he will
leave the humble abodes of men, so he will shake off ‘⁴ this mortal
coil,’' and cesse to be an object of human sympatby or sorrow.
He wishes not for the empty honora of a burhl, nor tha waste of
useless tears on his account, since he shall not die. ⁴
