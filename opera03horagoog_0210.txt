ODE l.

'l'ers ode is supposed to have been written by Horace, aster the
ulduinus ἓῖἒὲᾞῖἓ ,tt {Sittiltilttt litt,
the'dtffedent wiews of men with respect to happiness, and portrays
some of their ruling pussions. ln conclusion, be compliments
Maecenas on his teste for the fine arts, and his love of learning, by

to men of learning and os genius, was escended from the ancient
kings of Etruria or Tuscuny. To him, says Mr.Sanadon, the pres·

ing of the Augustan agc3 ond even at this day the name oance·
nas is a title not unworthy of persons of the noblest character, who
know, like him, how to animate the spirit of emulation among wri-

mans.

7. Hunc.- sc. juoot3 i. e. one ambitious of political distinction.

8. Tergcmioio tollen bononbuae ‘to rcise him to the highest
honore? The word tergeminis is probably used in reference to
the three highest grades of office among the Romans, vin the edile·
sbip, tho pretorsbrp, and the consulship.
