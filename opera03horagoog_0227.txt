ODE XXII.

Mr. Sanadon says, that Horace was at an entertainment where
a disputa began to infiame some of the company already heated
with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by grave ad-
vice and sober reasoning, he gayly proposed to drown ul disputes
iii a humper; which having succeeded, he wrote a few lines on

eoccas1on.

5. runo et lucernis . .. discrepat: ‘how strangely abhorrent is
the Persian swerd from wine and candles :’ i. athe festive board3
for the Romans usually had their entertainments by canule-light

8. coreo . . . presso: this alludes to the custorn of reclining at
table with the lest elbow resting on a couch.

ODE XXIII.

The occasion ofthis ode is not known3 although it has been the
subject of various conjectures. Itis a dialogue, represented as
having taken place between a mariner and the shade of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher os Tarentum

Archytae had been shipwrecked on the coust of Apulia3 and
the poet represents a mariner, who had accidentally found his
body driven ashore by the wevcs, as thus exclaiming: ‘And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How small a space you cover,
who could measure the heuvens, the earth, and the sea! The ad-
dress ofthe mariner occupies the first six verses3 and the reply
continues through the ode. ·

1. Tamaris mamre: the construction is, Archyta, paruo
memo exigui pulverio cohibentia merorem cauda et terra wenc-
wacaddhmidbdiim‘bidddivogec'diiiiirbzim iitddriirentators differ as to the
meaning of this word. Bentley and Doering consider it as here
given3 viz. ‘a small quantity of earth is sufficient for you now,
who lately stretched your mind over the vast expense of heaven,
the wide extended ocean, and the land. But Dacier, Gesner, and
others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little
dust to cover your body dctoirrs you from the Elysian fields ;’ allu-
ding to the prevailing elief that the soul could not pass the Styx
under a hundred years, if the body were not buried To this, ref-
erence is mede at the conclusion of the ode, where the mariner is
entreeted to render this little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.

7. Occidit: The shade of Archytas here replies to this effecte
‘Do nothe surprised, meriner, that I have shared the common lot
of humanity3 for Tantalus died, though he was admitted to the
society of the girgn and Tithonus, Pythagoras,’ dcc. Archytas
