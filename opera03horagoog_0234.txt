ODE 1.

Asrnrns Ponnro, a soldier, a stateman, and a scholar, had also
distinguished himselfas a tragic writer, and had raised the repu-
tation of the Roman stage nearly to an equality with that of Ath-
ens. But Pollio was engaged in awork better deserving his whole
strength and attention. This was a history of the civil waic, in
which he had slready advanced considerably, when Horace, ap
prehensive that the applause which Pollio received from the stage
mi bt interrupt a history so interesting to the republic, wrote this
Ο e to urge him to persevere. And at the same time he exhorts
Pollio not to be diverted from this object, he reminds him how deli·
cate and dangerous a taslr he had undertahen.

without offending Augustus, or disobi' 'ng many familias that had
been deeply engaged in the civil migr opening afresh wounds
that were now nearly healed.

favorite pursuit, and abstain from writing tragedies, till you have
put the finishing hand to a work of so much importance ss that
in which you are engaged.

{lie willemus, or buskin, was frequently put for tragedy, which
had at that time reached agrester degree of excellence at Athens
than at any other place.

From the expression publicas res ordinent, many have supposed
Pollio was consul at the time this ode was written, and that this
sentence hod reference to the management of public business.
